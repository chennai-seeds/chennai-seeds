I spent less that $500 in cash to purchase flight tickets for my inlaws from India to USA.

Credit card companies give huge sign up bonus that makes this possible.

I had applied for citi AAdvantage card, chase sapphire card and united mileage plus card. Here is the math.

##Earning Points


|**Credit Card** | **Signup bonus recieved**|**Card Annual Fee**
|:---|:---|---:
|Chase sapphire card|40,000 [mileage plus points][mg]|$0
|united mileage plus card|30,000 [ultimate reward points] [ur] converted to 30,000 [mileage plus points][mg]|$0
|Citi AAdvantage card|100,000 [aadvantage points] [aa]|$250

Apart from the signup bonuses. I recieved 15,000 [mileage plus points][mg] for my shopping.


##Redeeming ponits


|**Travel**|**Airlines**|**Fees**|**Points Needed**|**Total cost**
|---|---|---|---|---:
|Chennai to Miami|Lufthansa|Around $160 for 2 |85,000 for 2 |$160
|Tampa to Chennai|Qatar|Around $90 for 2  | 90,000 for 2 | $90 + $250 (card fee) = $340


*Where is the catch?* you ask me. I am glad you did. All these credit cards require you to spend some amount initially.. like $2,000 to $10,000. For a family of 3 to 4, this will be a normal amount you spend within 2 to 3 months.

Here it is. One less reason to put off that travel you are planning.
